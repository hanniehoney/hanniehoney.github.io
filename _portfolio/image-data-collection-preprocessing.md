## Background
Employed the open-source image generation model, Stable Diffusion 2, which initially did not meet customer quality expectations for our targeted uses in e-commerce, marketing, and advertising.

## Purpose
To gather a substantial volume of product imagery for e-commerce, marketing, and advertising, we established an automated web scraping system paired with a semi-automated filtering model. This model selectively filters out undesirable images such as selfies, explicit content, and cartoons to meet specific content policies, using pre-trained models enhanced with tailored conditions for image selection. Additionally, we documented the data sources to comply with platform-specific usage policies and ensure preparedness in risk management.

## Significance
- Collected 1 million images from 6+ target platforms using web scraping, ensuring policy-compliant data collection.
- Implemented an automated filtering system that achieved an 81.56% success rate in preparing data for AI model training, employing classification, object detection, and SVM algorithms for efficient data filtering and model training.
- Developed a data source tracking pipeline to monitor data status and updates, facilitating efficient data management, risk management, and taxonomy development for data collection system.
