## Background
After launching our image generator API, we received reports of poor image quality from enterprise customers, indicating that the product was not meeting user needs.

## Purpose
To enhance API performance, we initiated a capability assessment by conducting user interviews and collaborating with partners to gather comprehensive B2B feedback. We implemented a feedback ticket system to facilitate capability elicitation, enabling the R&D team to undertake multiple iterations of algorithm enhancements. This iterative process was meticulously documented, focusing on changes in model usage, algorithm response times, and output quality, which were crucial in optimizing the API product.

## Significance
- Boosted output quality from 26.98% to 62.75% by integrating object detection with GPT-4 for advanced LLM-enhanced image optimization.
- Achieved a 5X increase in API documentation views within 8 weeks.
