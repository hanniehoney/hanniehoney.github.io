## Background
In 2018, the AI fashion chatbot, designed to recommend fashion items based on user-uploaded photos, faced a significant challenge due to the absence of mature fashion item detection models.

## Purpose
To train effective models for our AI chatbot, we established an in-house annotation system using the open-source 'Deep Fashion' dataset. This required meticulously cleaning the data to align with our model's objectives, enhancing our AI product development process and contributing to Human-AI interaction improvements.

## Significance
- Successfully managed over 500 applicants for the annotation project.
- Led a dedicated team of more than 20 annotators who successfully labeled over 100,000 images with complex fashion labels, supporting our AGI preparedness by refining our modelâ€™s ability to understand and process fashion-related imagery.
- Developed comprehensive labeling guidelines that not only ensure data consistency but also uphold stringent privacy standards and ethical considerations, reflecting our commitment to product and user policies.
