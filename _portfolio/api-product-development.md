## Background
Enable users requiring image generation to make requests via API, using a token exchange mechanism for enhanced security.

## Purpose
Provide a simple, clear, and directly testable API doc. Users can make requests using API tokens once backend user permissions are granted. The API is designed with information security in mind, using a token exchange mechanism instead of API keys from the start.

## Significance
- Researched and tested 17+ frontier AI models to refine the API's output, focusing on establishing robust content policies and guidelines that ensure the visual outputs align with AI safety standards.
- Successfully developed 11 API endpoints across various functionalities, adhering to the PRD's specifications to broaden the API's scope and utility.
- Achieved seamless onboarding and testing within 30 minutes.
