## Background
Evaluating image differences between image generation AI model versions is challenging, hindering cross-team communication and human assessment of model performance.

## Purpose
Automatically test AI models in beta environments across versions using Python and Airtable Restful API integration, enabling model evaluation through a visualized gallery.

## Significance
- Conducted visual quality assessments by human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms
- Conducted beta testing on 11 AI model versions for thorough evaluation.
- Successfully generated over 3,200 high-quality AI images
