This study investigates color harmony principles in fashion for online shopping using psychophysical methods. Fifty observers rated images based on color harmony, liking, and fashionableness. Results showed that light skin tones generally enhanced harmony, with little difference between gender groups. The study tested lightness, chroma, and hue principles, finding varying impacts on perceived harmony. Higher chroma typically reduced harmony, while complementary hues often enhanced it.
